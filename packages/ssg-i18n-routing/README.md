# Showcase app with [React Intl][] and SSG

This showcase app shows how to integrate React Intl with Next.js and have Static Site Generation (SSG) in multiple languages.

Deploy it to the cloud with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=next-showcase) ([Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment)).

## Examples

This showcase is generated for two languages :
- [English](https://next-showcase-ssg-en.vercel.app/)
- [French](https://next-showcase-ssg-fr.vercel.app/)

## Features of this showcase app

- React Intl integration with [custom App](https://github.com/vercel/next.js#custom-app) component
- `<IntlProvider>` creation with `locale`, `messages` props
- Default message extraction via `@formatjs/cli` integration
- Pre-compile messages into AST with `babel-plugin-react-intl` for performance
- Translation management via build script

### Translation Management

This app stores translations and default strings in the `lang/` dir. The default messages (`en.json` in this showcase app) is also generated by the build script. This file can then be sent to a translation service to perform localization for the other locales the app should support.

The translated messages files that exist at `lang/*.json` are only used during production, and are automatically provided to the `<IntlProvider>`. During development the `defaultMessage`s defined in the source code are used. To prepare the showcase app for localization and production run the build script and start the server in production mode:

```bash
$ npm run build
$ npm start
```
